Hi, I'm Stefan. You can also find me at [stfn.work](https://stfn.work/). I'm a researcher and technical communicator on technology and the ethics of technology, combining technical, design-based, and social science perspectives. 

I have experience in academic and public research and policy development, technical  support and technical writing, and customer service. Also knowledgeable in web development, general purpose programming, and data analysis.

I was previously associated with [The Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies](https://github.com/uvicpraxis) at the University of Victoria.

I'm an [amateur photographer](https://stfn.work/photography/). I like to read about how digital cameras work. And I love to cook.

If you'd like to get in touch with me to chat further, you can reach me at <stefanachiggins@gmail.com>
