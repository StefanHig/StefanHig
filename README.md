Hi, I'm Stefan. I'm a researcher and communicator on technology and the ethics of technology, combining technical, design-based, and philosophical perspectives. 
I have experience in qualitative and quantitative academic and public research, technical infrastructure support, and communications, and I was previously an interdisciplinary academic researcher with foci in English, media and technology, and data.

I've recently been expanding my knowledge of data infrastructure(s) and their programming:
- I took a [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/f97374f6-44b0-4e4f-b66e-ef21517b4d76?source=linked_in_profile) (spreadsheets, SQL, R)
- Now I'm taking a programming course in Python to round out my ability to deal with (rather than just talk about) data structures

I was also previously associated with [The Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies](https://github.com/uvicpraxis) at the University of Victoria.

You can find some of the other writing and academic-y work I've done [here](http://stefanhiggins.com/other-work).

Finally, I'm an [amateur photographer](http://stefanhiggins.com/). I like to read about how digital cameras work. And I love to cook.

If you'd like to get in touch with me to chat further, you can reach me at <stef18@shaw.ca>
